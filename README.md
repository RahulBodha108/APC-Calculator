# APC-Calculator
This project implements arbitrary-precision arithmetic, enabling operations on numbers with precision limited only by system memory. It supports basic mathematical, modulus, and power operators for large integers. Enhance your understanding of order complexity, abstract data types (ADT), and self-referential structures using linked lists.
